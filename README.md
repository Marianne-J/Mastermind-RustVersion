# Overview

This is a second version of the game Mastermind, written in Rust instead of C++. Two players try to guess the code generated by the program. The first player to guess the code wins the game. The program is meant to function exactly the same as the C++ version.

My purpose in writing this program was to learn how to and practice writing in Rust.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
